    "\n",
    "# Context \n",
    "Income inequality is an increasingly urgent issue today.  Education is an important component for obtaining employment and income, and it's difficult to do so without one. The price of rental housing has been increasing, together with stagnant income, housing has become more and more unaffordable for most Americans. \n",

    "# Metrics/Methodology \n",

    "1. Household income Distribution is measured by income skewness coefficient calculated with Pearson's skewness formula: 3*(mean - median)/ standard deviation. A coefficient higher than 1 means the data is highly skewed, or in this case, income is not distributed evenly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rent affordability is measured by rent GT30 and rent GT50. \n",
    "        Rent GT 30 is the empirical distribution value that an individual’s rent was greater than 30% of their household income in the past 12 months. \n",
    "        Rent GT 50 is the empirical distribution value that an individual’s rent was greater than 50% of their household income in the past 12 months. \n",

    "1. Education\n",
    "In today's competitive market, a high school diploma is a bare minimum requirement. A college education is often required to obtain employment. Places with lower graduation rates tend to have higher inequality. Probably because people without the degree mostly work at jobs that pay minimum wages where room for income raise is limited. In todat's competitive market, high school diploma is the minimum requirement. Often times college education is required. \n",

In certain areas, more than 80% of the residents with education and high income still spent more than 30% of their income on rent. \n",
